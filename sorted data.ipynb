        "\n",
        "Import multiple similar files into python.\n",
        "Concatenate the data into one big table.\n",
        "Add some columns and export data into one CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise you have to create a python script (or Jupyter Notebook) to load data from different files, organized in folders and with names according to some predefined pattern.\n",
        "Concatenate the results, add one column and export the data into one file.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input files are given in the listings3.zip file, you can extract the files from the archive but no modification of the files is permitted before importing data into python. The files are guaranteed to have the same format, so if you correctly import one file, you can use the same parameters to import all the others.\n",
        "To simplify the import of the data, the unzipped files are also present in the COURSE_PATH at ex3/listings3/ .\n",
        "## Notes\n",
        "1. The input files have the same format, so open one input\n",
        "file manually, check it and repeat until you are happy with the result.\n",
        "2. Create a loop over all the input files and import each file in the loop. Add the resulting DataFrame into a list. After the loop, you can concatenate all the DataFrames into one result DataFrame. Inspect the imported results.\n",
        "3. Sort the data by price and print the top and bottom 20 listings by price. Do you notice something?\n",
        "4. Find a solution to point 3, without changing any data. Hint: add a new column and sort by that new column instead.\n",
        "Save the data including the new column into a new file named: \"output/listings2020_2021_by_price.csv\"\n",
        "5. (Optional) Create a second notebook, that only loads all the files for one year, then adds the column, sorts the data and writes the result into: \"output/listings{year}_by_price.csv\". Of course, {year} should be replaced with the year. In the case of the input for exercise 3, it should create 2 files, one for the year 2020 and one for the year 2021. The program should be flexible and work reliably even if you have more than 2 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Deliverables\n",
        "A python script or Jupyter Notebook that solves the exercise. The output CSV or Excel file(s). (should be visible in your group GDrive folder)\n",
        "Explain the steps you took and  the difficulties you encountered, directly in the Python Notebook.\n"
